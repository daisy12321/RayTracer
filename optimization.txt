4. Our optimizations included

	- Adding local variables to reduce function calls in inner loops
	- Removing redundant computations
	- Where possible, using multiplication instead of division
	- Removing unneccessary Vector3 instantiations
	- Setting the rayIn.end to the minimum t we found
	- Multithreading like it's 1999!
	
We saw some slowdown for small inputs since there's overhead to creating and running threads,
but we saw a >4x speedup for our largest octopus scene (185s -> 45s)!
